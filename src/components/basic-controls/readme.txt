This directory hosts plain reusable Vue components for GUI widgets that are missing in HTML.
These are normal Solid components, not tied to the ViewProps architecture.
For example, since radio buttons are available in HTML as <input type=radio>, without doubt, they are not included here.
As another example, HTML <progress> is impossible to style. Therefore an alternate plain old <div> version is here.
